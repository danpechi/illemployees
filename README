Each legislative employee's first name, last name, division, and position was 
collected from the Illinois State Comptroller's Salary Database. There are 
over 1300 people employed by the Illinois Legislature. The most popular 
baby names for boys and girls from 1950 to 2010 were collected from the 
federal government's social security website. Any names that appeared in both 
the boy's and girl's name list were considered gender neutral names and removed 
from the gender-name database. Each employee was then assigned a gender by a 
program, and any remaining "unknown" genders were evaluated on a case by case 
basis. I determined the gender of the remaining individuals by searching for any 
records they may have on the internet. In the end, 59 employees had unknown 
genders, most of whom were contactual workers.
